                                    ‘It costs less’

                                    In Mosul, 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Baghdad, just being permitted to watch football marks a fresh dawn — for three years to July 2017, Iraq’s second city was occupied by the Islamic State group.

                                    Mirroring the capital, people have crammed into cafes to watch games, happy at last to imbibe images the jihadists deemed corrupting.
                                    “Here, it costs less,” said 21-year-old Amir Mufak, another Iraqi who can’t afford to sustain his passion by watching at home.
                                    “We pay only for our drinks — the fun is free.”

                                    With the World Cup in full swing, people around the globe are glued to TV screens-but for some Iraqis, absorbing the full experience is proving trickier than confronting Lionel Messi on an epic dribble.

                                    At around $100 (85 euros), a pay TV subscription for the month-long football extravaganza is out of reach for most, as average monthly salaries range between $400 and $700.

                                    But some are airing the games and even profiting from the action.

                                    In a central Baghdad cafe, Hassan al-Sayyed has installed a big screen, AFP reports.

                                    He hopes to fill his premises for every game, ramping up takings from those unable to afford the “very high” cost of home subscriptions.

                                    One of the biggest pulls so far has been Egypt’s second group game — a chance to see the Arab world’s most famous footballer Mohamed Salah make his tournament debut. Hookah smoke swirling around him, Mohammed Hassan was one of many to cheer on the Liverpool ace during the Pharaohs’ 3-1 loss to Russia.

                                    “We come here every day to watch the games, mainly for economic reasons,” he told AFP, bemoaning the cost of the pay TV subscription.
                                    With Salah’s Egypt eliminated, Hassan will now cheer on Messi’s Argentina and Spain, even while he dreams of Iraq one day making a first World Cup finals appearance since Mexico ’86.

                                    Beijing : The European Union and China pledged on Monday to uphold a rules-based international trade system, making an oblique criticism of growing protectionism in Washington despite their own disagreements.

                                    The two sides held high-level economic meetings in Beijing as both face rising trade tensions with the United States. Brussels and Beijing recently announced new tariffs on US goods in retaliation for moves by the Trump administration.

                                    “Both sides agreed to resolutely oppose unilateralism and protectionism and prevent such practices from impacting the world economy and even dragging the world economy into recession,” said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, responsible for shepherding the world’s second largest economy.

                                    Liu had led China’s three rounds of trade talks with the US, negotiations that have broken down over the Trump administration’s pledge to move forward with tariffs despite an agreement in May to put the duties on hold.

                                    “Unilateralism and trade protectionism is on the rise and tensions have appeared in the economic relations between major economies,” Liu told an audience of European and Chinese officials.

                                    European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen echoed Liu’s words, describing the World Trade Organization “as the centre of the rules-based international our near and dear ones can support us to have a clear and conclusive condition of our life. And parents are more than that obviously.
